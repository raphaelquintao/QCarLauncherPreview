# QCarLauncherPreview

QCarLauncher is a feature-packed car launcher, built from scratch for my own personal use (because why not go overboard for your own obsessions?)

## Features
- Modern UI for easy navigation!
- Integration with [this headunit](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005005875430250.html) for AUDI
- DeeLife TPMS MU7J-5 support (other versions might work, but who knows?)
- Only Spotify and Google Maps integration for now (more apps might come later)

## Status
- Still in development, and honestly, it might stay that way forever
- Built for my own use, so expect all the permissions and a bit of chaos
- No promises about the future, but hey, it's here now!
